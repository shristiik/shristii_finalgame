Description of the Process
What Did You Learn?
Improved understanding of game development using Pygame.
Enhanced skills in object-oriented programming and state management.
Learned how to incorporate multimedia elements such as images and sounds into a game.

Where Did You Get Stuck?
Managing game state transitions smoothly was challenging initially.
Ensuring correct synchronization of sound playback with game events required careful handling.
ALSO the sprites didn;t show up even though it was loaded and printed.

What Would You Like to Improve?
Add more dynamic and visually appealing graphics and animations.
Include more eras and a wider range of questions for greater variety.
Implement a leaderboard to track high scores and encourage competition.

How Would You Do Things Differently Next Time?
Plan the game structure more thoroughly before coding to avoid refactoring later.
Invest more time in designing and testing the user interface for better user experience.
Use a more structured approach to handling multimedia assets to simplify loading and management.

How Far Did You Stray from the Game Design Document?
I made it really really simple as compared to the designed that was proposed.

How Did You Stay on Track?
